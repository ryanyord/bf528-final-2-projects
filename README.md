# Repository Contents

Directory scripts contain code for the biologist 3 (biologist_3.Rmd) and biologist 1 role (biologist_1.Rmd). 
Complete report/write up can be found in parent directory (Report.pdf).

# Workflow
To replicate our analysis run all respective .Rmd scripts after installing library dependencies.<br/>

Note:  File paths are hard coded and will need to be updated when utilized outside of SCC.
